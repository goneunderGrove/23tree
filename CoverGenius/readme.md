## About
This Python code reads data from an Excel workbook and uses it to fill in placeholders in a Word document to create a cover letter. It then saves the resulting cover letter and a general resume in a directory named after the company being applied to. The code starts by defining file paths for the main directory, the template, and the workbook. It then loads the files and defines the placeholders to be filled in the Word document. The code then iterates through each sheet in the workbook and fills in the values for each column in the sheet. Finally, it saves the resulting cover letter and general resume in a directory named after the company being applied to.

## Install Requiments
In the terminal type the following command 
>``pip install -r requirements.txt``

# Update file

> Open ``Automate_doc_file.py``
Use the output to update line 10 
> ``main_path = r"[*insert output from pwd*]"``

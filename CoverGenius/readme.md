## Install Requiments 

This program will generate a custom cover letter using a formated one and filling in the blaks. Currently it is only able to make a cover letter for cyber security jobs. Later version will include a more robust number of options. To use you must fill out the the excel file adding to each field. The infomtions inputed will produce a dirctory containing a resume (for Christopher Raymond ) and a cover letter tailored to the job in question.

In the terminal type the following command 
>``pip install -r requirements.txt``

# Update file
Navigate to the file in the terminal and type ``pwd``
> Open ``Automate_doc_file.py``
Use the output to update line 10 
> ``main_path = r"[*insert output from pwd*]"``

Lastly type ``python Automate_doc_file.py``
